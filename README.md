# Image recognition system to predict and prevent satellite/space debris collisions

## The Future of Space Technology
The future of Space Technology and exploration comes in more technology to diagnose problems before they even come up. Space is like no other area of innovation; the training wheels that may exist on Earth are completely off. Any issue in space must be solved quickly, and preferably there should be no issue at all. If problems can be prevented, we can start to explore more and more of the universe, build a comprehensive galactic network, and even connect with other planets.

## What's stopping us from reaching the future
Right now, space technology has a few massive barriers in terms of transportation. One is fuel, one is communications, and one is intraspace logistics. Even if the issues of fuel and communications have been solved, if a rocket or a spaceship can't navigate past the Solar System, nothing of note can happen. We need to solve the issues happening in space for us to progress forward with our dream.

## How we are building the future with ColiPrev
ColiPrev is representative of our entire platform, as it is short for Collision Prevention. We are solving an aspect of intraspace logistical problems with calculus and an image recognition software. 

### The Calculus
If given all the base information on the asteroid and the satellite, such as the position, our software can create a map of both to find their velocity and possible collision. We can map out both parts in a 3 dimensional space, and we can find out if the absolute minimum of the distance between the two is low enough to call for some level of change. If the two pass each other with more than 50 thousand feet of separation, there is no cause for alarm, but if under the threshold additional action must occur. 

### The Image Recognition
Our image recognition software can detect an asteroid as a whole. A camera will be placed on the exterior of the spaceship, and will detect any debris that may come in its field of vision. The camera shall take a series of pictures if there is something to detect that is abnormal, and these pictures will be fed through a neural network that can predict the distance of the debris from the satellite. These two methods of calculation can allow for a system to detect an issue before it even arises, and with it we have the potential to engineer better space flight throughout the cosmos.

## Team
We are a team of three high schoolers from Brookline, Massachusetts. We had created a Hackathon Club in our high school, and assembled a team for this hackathon. We are all passionate about solving global (and beyond!) issues with technology, and we are united in that certain emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, can help alleviate the stress that billions live their lives under.

## How we built our project
Given the prompt of "Astro", we immediately thought of space technology and travelling the universe. We created a mutually exclusive, collectively exhausting board to discuss space travel and issues we could tackle within the time limit, and we eventually landed upon fixing collisions, one of the worst case scenarios that can happen in intraspace flight that we have seen throughout history. We decided to use AI as well because an AI can be continually improved, and we can make sure that our solution is on a feedback loop of success. 

If we were to expand this project in the future, we would use the space debris image recognition system to have a satellite recognize and take multiple photos of space debris. Over a small period of time, we would be able to calculate the trajectory of the space debris using its distance in relation to the satellite taking the pictures. Finally, we would be able to track if the space debris seen by the satellite would collide with the satellite by mapping their orbital paths (as shown in the demonstrated video).

## Obstacles
We had difficulties finding images of space debris to train our algorithm. As a result, we were forced to use an image set of asteroids. Therefore, the image recognition serves more as a proof of concept rather than being specifically applicable to our use case.
